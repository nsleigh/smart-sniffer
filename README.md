---

Uncorrectable errors. Pending failures quietly piling up. 🙀

SMART drives say "PASSED" right up until the end. 😵

Sniff early. Sniff often. 🕵️‍♂️

SMART Sniffer follows the trail, sniffing out the [early warning signs](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html) your drives won't tell you about and reporting them to Home Assistant before it's too late. One agent per machine. Every drive gets a health score. Alerts fire automatically. No automations required.

<br>

## Features

**Early warning alerts** — The Attention Needed sensor monitors leading indicators of failure across ATA, SATA, NVMe, and SAS drives. Four clear states: `NO` · `MAYBE` · `YES` · `UNSUPPORTED`.

**Zero-config notifications** — Persistent notifications fire automatically when drive health changes. No automations or blueprints to set up. Alerts escalate, de-escalate, and auto-dismiss.

**Disk usage monitoring** — Opt-in filesystem tracking during install. Monitor storage utilization on any mountpoint — the agent reports total, used, available bytes and percentage via a dedicated API endpoint.

**Multi-machine monitoring** — Install a lightweight Go agent on each machine. Each drive appears as its own HA device with full sensor entities and diagnostics.

**Auto-discovery** — Agents advertise themselves on the local network via mDNS/Zeroconf. Home Assistant discovers them automatically — no manual IP entry needed.

**Secure by default** — Optional bearer token authentication between agent and integration. SHA256-verified binary downloads.

<br>

## How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/smartsniffer-architecture.png" alt="Architecture diagram" width="100%">
</p>

Each machine runs a lightweight `smartha-agent` binary that wraps `smartctl` and serves SMART data over HTTP. The HA integration polls each agent and creates devices, sensors, and health alerts for every drive it finds.

<details>
<summary><strong>Entities per drive</strong></summary>

<br>

Each drive gets its own HA device. Entities are created dynamically — if a drive doesn't report an attribute, the sensor is simply not created.

**Disk Usage** (per agent host, requires agent v0.5.0+ with filesystems configured):

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Disk Usage — Root (/) | Percentage used for the monitored mountpoint |

Attributes: `mountpoint`, `device`, `fstype`, `total_gb`, `used_gb`, `available_gb`. One sensor per mountpoint configured during agent install. Grouped under a "Disk Usage ({hostname})" device alongside the drive devices.

**Sensors:**

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Attention Needed | Proactive health alert — `NO` / `MAYBE` / `YES` / `UNSUPPORTED` |
| Health | SMART pass/fail — OK, Problem, or Unknown |
| Standby | Whether the drive is currently spun down. When On, exposes a `data_as_of` attribute showing when the cached SMART readings were last refreshed. |
| Temperature | Current drive temp (°C) |
| Power-On Hours | Total hours powered on |
| SMART Status | Raw SMART verdict (PASSED / FAILED) |

**Diagnostic sensors** (conditional):

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Reallocated Sector Count | Bad sectors remapped to spares (ATA) |
| Reported Uncorrectable Errors | Unrecoverable read/write errors (ATA) |
| Wear Leveling / Percentage Used | SSD endurance indicator |
| Power Cycle Count | Total power on/off cycles |
| Reallocated Event Count | Individual reallocation events (ATA) |
| Spin Retry Count | Motor spin-up retries — HDD only |
| Command Timeout | Internal command timeouts |
| Available Spare | NVMe reserve block pool (%) |
| Available Spare Threshold | Manufacturer-set minimum spare (%) |
| Current Pending Sector Count | Sectors waiting for reallocation (ATA) |

**Vendor-specific SMART attributes** (ATA/SATA drives in smartctl database, disabled by default):

For drives recognized by smartctl's database (`drivedb.h`), every named SMART attribute not already covered by the sensors above is created as a diagnostic entity. These are disabled by default -- enable what you need from the device page. Examples: erase counts, host writes/reads, program/erase fail counts, available reserved space, remaining lifetime percentage. The exact attributes vary by drive manufacturer and model.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Entities per agent</strong></summary>

<br>

Each agent host groups under its own HA device alongside the drive devices. These entities describe the agent itself rather than any one drive. Enabled-by-default entities show up as soon as you reload the integration; the rest are visible from the device page's "disabled" section and can be turned on from entity settings.

**Primary (enabled by default):**

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Agent Status | binary_sensor | Connectivity. On when reachable, Off when disconnected. Stays available across outages so automations can trigger on it. |
| Agent Version | sensor | Semantic version reported by the agent. Drives the "Agent version outdated" HA repair notification. |
| OS | sensor | Agent host OS: `linux`, `darwin`, or `windows`. Reports `unknown` for agents older than v0.5.3. |

**Diagnostic (disabled by default):**

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Agent Last Seen | sensor | Timestamp of the most recent successful poll. |
| Agent IP | sensor | IP address recorded for the agent in the HA config entry. |
| Agent Port | sensor | Port the agent is serving on (default 9099). |
| HA Poll Interval | sensor | How often Home Assistant polls the agent, in seconds. Distinct from the agent's own `scan_interval`. |
| Auth Active | binary_sensor | On when a bearer token is configured for this agent. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Attention Needed — how it classifies drives</strong></summary>

<br>

The Attention Needed sensor evaluates individual SMART attributes every poll cycle:

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **NO** | All monitored indicators clear | None required |
| **MAYBE** | Early degradation signals detected | Monitor closely, plan replacement |
| **YES** | Data integrity at risk | **Back up immediately** |
| **UNSUPPORTED** | No usable SMART data | Common with USB enclosures |

**Critical triggers (→ YES):** Reallocated sectors, pending sectors, uncorrectable errors, NVMe critical_warning, NVMe media_errors, spare depletion below threshold.

**Warning triggers (→ MAYBE):** Reallocated events, spin retry count, command timeouts, NVMe spare < 20%, NVMe percentage_used ≥ 90%.

When a drive's state changes, a persistent notification fires in HA automatically. Notifications escalate on worsening conditions and dismiss when resolved. See [attention-severity-logic.md](docs/attention-severity-logic.md) for the full specification.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent configuration</strong></summary>

<br>

Create `config.yaml` in the working directory or `/etc/smartha-agent/`:

```yaml
port: 9099
token: "your-secret-token"    # optional -- omit to disable auth
scan_interval: 60s
standby_mode: standby          # optional -- never, standby, sleep, or idle
advertise_interface: eth0      # optional -- restrict mDNS to this interface
exclude_devices:               # optional -- set by installer's drive picker
  - /dev/sdb
filesystems:                   # optional -- set by installer's disk usage picker
  - path: /
    uuid: a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab
    device: /dev/sda1
    fstype: ext4
```

All options can also be set via CLI flags: `--port`, `--token`, `--scan-interval`, `--interface`, `--config`.

**Exclude devices:** Device paths listed in `exclude_devices` are skipped during every scan. The agent resolves symlinks at startup, so `/dev/disk/by-id/...` paths and their `/dev/sdX` equivalents both match. The installer's drive picker (Linux) shows all detected drives and lets you choose which ones to monitor -- useful for excluding iSCSI LUNs, USB backup drives, or anything you don't want polled. Drives with remote-storage transports (iSCSI, Fibre Channel) are flagged in yellow and excluded from the default selection. You can also add paths manually and restart the service. If a device appears in both `exclude_devices` and `device_overrides`, the exclusion wins and a warning is logged.

**Scan interval:** Uses Go duration syntax -- `30s`, `5m`, `1h`, `24h` are all valid. When `standby_mode` is set, the agent skips sleeping drives and serves cached data, so the interval does not cause unnecessary wake-ups. When `standby_mode` is `never` (the default), each poll wakes any drive that is spun down. This is the *agent-side* read cadence and is separate from the HA Poll Interval entity, which reflects how often Home Assistant pulls fresh data from the agent itself.

**Standby mode:** Controls whether the agent avoids waking sleeping drives during polling. Set to `standby`, `sleep`, or `idle` to match your drives' power management (these correspond to `smartctl -n` modes). When set, the agent passes `-n <mode>` to smartctl on each poll -- if a drive is in that power state, smartctl exits without waking it and the agent serves the last cached SMART data with an `in_standby` flag. The default is `never`, which wakes drives on every poll. On the very first poll after startup, the agent always wakes all drives regardless of this setting to collect a SMART baseline (serial number, model, attributes). This one-time wake ensures every drive is registered with a stable identity from the start. Subsequent polls honor the standby setting normally.

**Network interface:** The `advertise_interface` setting restricts mDNS to a single interface. The installer sets this during setup if you pick a specific interface. When not set, the agent auto-filters known virtual interfaces (Docker, ZeroTier, Tailscale, WireGuard, etc.) and advertises on all remaining physical interfaces. To change the interface after install, edit `config.yaml` and restart the service — no reinstall needed.

**Authentication:** When a `token` is set, every request to the agent must include an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header — requests without it receive a `401 Unauthorized` response. When adding the agent in Home Assistant, enter the same token in the integration's config flow. If no token is set, the agent serves data openly without auth.

**Disk usage monitoring:** The installer's Disk Usage Monitoring picker lets you select which mountpoints to track. Each configured mountpoint is polled on the same interval as SMART data and served via `/api/filesystems`. Mountpoints are identified by UUID (via `blkid`) for stable entity identity across reboots. If no filesystems are configured, the endpoint simply isn't registered and callers receive a 404. To add or change monitored mountpoints after install, re-run the installer or edit `config.yaml` directly and restart the service.

**Auto-discovery:** The agent advertises itself on the local network via mDNS (Zeroconf) by default. HA automatically detects running agents and prompts you to set them up — no manual IP entry needed. Disable with `mdns: false` in config or `--no-mdns` flag. Note: mDNS is link-local, so agents on different VLANs won't be discovered without an mDNS reflector.

**Multi-homed hosts:** Machines running Docker, VPNs (ZeroTier, Tailscale, WireGuard), or virtual bridges have multiple network interfaces. If the agent advertises on a VPN or container interface, HA may discover it at an unreachable IP and fail to connect. The installer's interface picker and the `advertise_interface` config option solve this — see [Platform Install Paths](docs/platform-install-paths.md) for details.

**API endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/health` | Agent status, version, available endpoints, drive/filesystem counts |
| `GET /api/drives` | Summary list of all discovered drives |
| `GET /api/drives/{id}` | Full SMART data for a single drive |
| `GET /api/filesystems` | Disk usage for all configured mountpoints (only registered when filesystems are configured) |

**Service management:**

| Platform | Status | Logs | Restart |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Linux | `systemctl status smartha-agent` | `journalctl -u smartha-agent -f` | `systemctl restart smartha-agent` |
| macOS | `launchctl list \| grep smartha` | `tail -f /var/log/smartha-agent.log` | `sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.dablabs.smartha-agent` |
| Windows | `Get-Service SmartHA-Agent` | Event Viewer | `Restart-Service SmartHA-Agent` |

## Quick Start

**Requires:** `smartmontools` **7.0+** on each monitored machine (for JSON output support). The installer handles installation automatically (Homebrew on macOS, apt/dnf/yum on Linux), but some older distros ship smartctl 6.x which does not support the `--json` flag the agent relies on. Run `smartctl --version` to check. If you're on 6.x, install a newer version from the [smartmontools releases page](https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Download) or from a backports repository.

**Optional:** `btrfs-progs` is recommended on systems with btrfs filesystems. The installer's disk-usage picker and the agent's `/api/filesystems` endpoint both fall back to `btrfs filesystem usage --raw` when `statvfs` returns zero on a btrfs mount (a known quirk on some multi-device or near-full configurations). Without `btrfs-progs`, btrfs entries display as `(unknown size)` in the picker and report zero-byte usage from the API. Most distros include `btrfs-progs` by default if any btrfs filesystems exist on the system.

### 1. Install the agent

Run on each machine you want to monitor:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAB-LABS/smart-sniffer/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

<details>
<summary>Windows (PowerShell as Admin)</summary>

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAB-LABS/smart-sniffer/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

> **Important:** This must be run from **PowerShell**, not Command Prompt (CMD). If you see `'irm' is not recognized`, you're in CMD -- open PowerShell as Administrator instead. Right-click the Start button and select **Terminal (Admin)** or search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu.

> **Note:** Requires v0.5.1 or later. Earlier Windows builds had a service startup bug tracked as [#13](https://github.com/DAB-LABS/smart-sniffer/issues/13). Service events appear in Event Viewer under Windows Logs → Application with source `SmartHA-Agent`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>macOS: "unidentified developer" warning</summary>

The agent binary is not code-signed or notarized. macOS Gatekeeper will block it on first run with a "cannot be opened" or "unidentified developer" dialog.

If you installed via the install script, remove the quarantine flag manually:

```bash
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/smartha-agent
```

Then restart the service:

```bash
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.dablabs.smartha-agent
```

Alternatively, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, find the blocked app, and click **Open Anyway**.

> **Note:** The right-click > Open workaround was removed in macOS Sequoia (15.0). The `xattr` method above works on all current macOS versions including Sequoia.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Pin a specific version</summary>

```bash
VERSION=0.1.0 curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAB-LABS/smart-sniffer/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

</details>

The installer detects your OS and architecture, downloads the correct binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DAB-LABS/smart-sniffer/releases), verifies the SHA256 checksum, installs `smartmontools` if missing, prompts for configuration (port, token, scan interval, disk usage monitoring, mDNS interface), and sets up a system service.

Disk usage monitoring is opt-in. During a fresh install or upgrade to v0.5.0+, the installer asks which mountpoints to monitor. Select the mountpoints you care about. The agent will report usage percentage, total/used/available bytes for each.

On machines with multiple network interfaces (Docker, ZeroTier, Tailscale, etc.), the installer presents an interface picker so mDNS discovery advertises on the right network. Pick your LAN interface — not "All interfaces" — if you run VPNs or containers, otherwise HA may discover the agent at an unreachable IP.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/agent_install_uninstall_screenshot.png" alt="Agent install on Linux" width="520">
</p>

<details>
<summary>Uninstall the agent</summary>

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAB-LABS/smart-sniffer/main/install.sh | sudo UNINSTALL=1 bash
```

Stops the service, removes the binary, config, and service files.

</details>

### 2. Add the integration to Home Assistant

**Via HACS (recommended):**

1. Open HACS → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/DAB-LABS/smart-sniffer` · Category: **Integration**
3. Download **SMART Sniffer** → Restart HA

**Manual:** Copy `custom_components/smart_sniffer/` into your HA `custom_components/` directory and restart.

### 3. Connect to the agent

**Auto-discovery (recommended):** The agent advertises itself via mDNS. After a few seconds Home Assistant will show a discovery notification — just click **Add** and you're done. If the agent has a bearer token, you'll be prompted for it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/discovery-screenshot-mock.svg" alt="Auto-discovery prompt" width="400">
</p>

**Manual:** **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → SMART Sniffer** — enter the agent's host, port, optional token, and polling interval.

Every drive on the machine appears as its own HA device.

## NAS & RAID Setup

Most Linux, macOS and Windows machines work out of the box. NAS devices and RAID controllers sometimes need extra steps because their storage controllers present drives differently than standard SATA/NVMe.

**Platform guides:** For step-by-step walkthroughs on specific platforms, see the [Platform Installation Guides](docs/guides/) -- covering Synology, QNAP, TrueNAS SCALE, Unraid, Proxmox, Docker, virtual machines, and hardware RAID controllers.

### Diagnosing drive detection

If the agent starts but reports no drives (or fewer than expected), run:

```bash
smartha-agent --discover
```

This probes every drive the OS exposes, tests protocol detection, and tells you exactly what the agent will see at runtime. If any drives need manual configuration, it offers to write the config for you. See the [Drive Discovery guide](docs/discover.md) for full details and example output.

Paste the `--discover` output into a GitHub issue if you need help -- it gives us everything we need to diagnose remotely.

### Raw SMART data

Need the full SMART dump for a drive? The integration includes everything smartctl returns in the diagnostics download. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > SMART Sniffer > three-dot menu > Download Diagnostics**. The downloaded JSON file contains the complete raw SMART data for every drive on that agent, along with the attention evaluation and agent metadata. Useful for debugging unexpected sensor values, sharing in bug reports, or passing to an AI for deeper analysis.

The agent also exposes raw data via its REST API at `http://<agent-ip>:9099/api/drives` (summary) and `http://<agent-ip>:9099/api/drives/{id}` (full SMART JSON for a single drive).

### NAS devices

NAS platforms have platform-specific quirks -- proprietary device paths (Synology), SCSI-to-ATA protocol mismatches (QNAP), outdated smartmontools versions, and LXC bridge interfaces that confuse mDNS. The agent handles most of this automatically since v0.5.5, but some platforms need `device_overrides` or a newer smartmontools. See the platform-specific guides: [Synology](docs/guides/synology.md), [QNAP](docs/guides/qnap.md), [TrueNAS SCALE](docs/guides/truenas-scale.md), [Unraid](docs/guides/unraid.md).

### Hardware RAID controllers

Drives behind hardware RAID controllers (MegaRAID, HP SmartArray, 3ware, Areca) are hidden from the OS behind the RAID layer. `smartctl` needs a RAID-specific device type flag to reach each physical drive. `--discover` does not probe RAID controllers yet, so these require manual `device_overrides`. See the [RAID Controllers guide](docs/guides/raid-controllers.md) for controller identification, drive enumeration, and config examples.

### smartmontools version

The agent requires smartmontools **7.0+** for JSON output support. Most current Linux distros ship 7.x. Older or embedded systems (Synology DSM, QNAP QTS, some RHEL/CentOS 7 installs) may ship 6.x or older. Run `smartctl --version` to check. The agent logs a clear error on startup if the version is too old.

<details>
<summary><strong>🔌 What about USB drives?</strong></summary>

<br>

External drives connected via USB enclosures typically block SMART passthrough. SMART Sniffer detects this and marks the drive as `UNSUPPORTED` with `Health: Unknown`.

<img src="images/unsupported-screenshot.png" width="280">

This is the most common "why isn't my drive showing data?" scenario. It's a hardware limitation of the USB bridge chip, not a bug.

## Community Deployments

| Deployment | Maintainer | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| [Docker](https://github.com/fireinice/docker-smart-sniffer) | [@fireinice](https://github.com/fireinice) | Dockerfile + auto-generated docker-compose with per-drive capability scoping. Available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fireinice/smart-sniffer). |

Note: disk usage monitoring (`/api/filesystems`) is not yet supported in Docker deployments. Container-aware path mapping is [on the roadmap](#roadmap).

## Testing

The integration has been tested against the included [Mock Agent](docs/mock-agent.md) — a standalone Python tool that simulates a `smartha-agent` with fully controllable fake drives. It serves the same API as the real agent, with a web dashboard for changing SMART attributes in real time. Useful for validating attention state transitions, notification behavior, and new drive types without waiting for real hardware to degrade.

```bash
python3 tools/mock-agent.py --port 9100 --preload sata_hdd,nvme,usb_blocked
```

Point the HA integration at `localhost:9100` and you're testing.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Have a drive that isn't mapping correctly? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to help.

Drive-specific `smartctl -a --json` output samples are especially welcome — they help us catch manufacturer name variants we haven't seen yet.

- [x] Vendor-specific SMART diagnostic entities (disabled-by-default, all named ATA attributes) -- shipped v0.5.7
- [ ] SAS/SCSI full attribute parsing (grown defect list, error counters, endurance indicators)
- [ ] Agent: container-aware filesystem reporting (MNT_PREFIX path mapping for Docker deployments)
- [ ] Agent: runtime interface detection (replace static prefix list with OS-level physical NIC detection)
- [ ] Integration: parent-agent device hierarchy + optional area-on-setup (drives nest under agent via `via_device`, area inherits via HA prompt)
- [ ] Integration: split consolidated wear-leveling / uncorrectable / pending-sector sensors into separate diagnostic entities when a drive reports multiple variants (v0.5.7 follow-up; affects multi-variant drives like Silicon Motion SSDs)
